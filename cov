Patch 1 & 2 can be applied independently from 3 and 4. I want to keep all
the patches together to provide a holistic view of changes required for
RISC-V UEFI.

Changes v4->v5:
1. Added comments for new functions.

Changes v3->v4:
1. Dropped generic efi fix patch as it is already merged.
2. Moved all the fdt fixups to a common file.
3. Addressed few nit comments.

Changes from v2->v3:
1. Update the DT meant for OS if it is different from the one used by U-Boot
2. Use different FDT api to obtain "reg" address & size to honor the cell count.

Changes from v1->v2:
1. Fix the issue if chosen node is not present.

Changes from previous version:
1. Renamed the DT node property to "boot-hartid" from "efi-boot-hartid".
2. Changed the property type to u32 instead of u64 for RV32 compatibility.
